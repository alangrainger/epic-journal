# Epic Journal

A free cross-platform encrypted daily journal / diary app, with full CSS styling. It is built with Sqlite3 and 
SQLcipher with AES 256 CBC encryption.

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Update 2019-09-14 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

I released the first version of Epic Journal in Nov 2017 after one month's coding experience.
As you can imagine, it was a bit rough around the edges...

I've been working on [a business project](https://www.easycrypto.nz/) since then and only just getting back into it now.
However I'm coming back with 2 years of coding experience, so this time it's serious! üöÄ 

I've upgraded all the bits of framework to the latest versions and I've switched to @journeyapps/sqlcipher so we can now
 build for MacOS and Linux without any issues.

I built it as a free and open replacement for *The Journal* by DavidRM, which I have used 
for many years. The main issues I wanted to solve were better styling, and the ability to know that my
entries are safe for the long-term, with an open and known database format.

## Upcoming features

I'll be working towards feature parity with The Journal, but the next things I'm working on are:

- Mobile app (nothing fancy, just to add entries on the go)
- Search. Good fast search.
- Multiple folders. They will be tabs above the editor - think of them as master categories.
- Linking between entries
- Minimise to tray, and hotkey open
- Notes folder ‚Äì i.e. non date-related entries
- Emoji support
